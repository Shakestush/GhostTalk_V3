- **Direct Peer Connections**: Connect directly to other users
- **Anonymous Relay System**: Messages routed through anonymous relays
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatic discovery of network peers
- **Multi-Peer Support**: Chat with multiple contacts simultaneously

### 💬 User Experience
- **Modern UI**: Sleek dark theme with glassmorphism effects
- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant message delivery with animations
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all devices
- **Status Dashboard**: Real-time connection and network status
- **Notification System**: Non-intrusive message notifications

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Quick Start
1. Download the `ghosttalk.html` file
2. Open it in any modern web browser
3. Start connecting to peers and messaging anonymously!

### Browser Requirements
- Chrome/Chromium 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

No installation, servers, or sign-ups required!

## 📱 Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Generate Identity**: Your anonymous Ghost ID is automatically created
2. **Connect to Peers**: Enter a peer's Ghost ID to establish connection
3. **Start Messaging**: Select a connected peer and begin chatting
4. **Stay Anonymous**: Your real identity and IP remain hidden

### Connecting to Peers
```
1. Obtain a peer's Ghost ID (format: GHOST_XXXXXXXX)
2. Enter the ID in the "Connect to Peer" field
3. Click "Connect" and wait for relay establishment
4. Start secure, anonymous messaging!
```

### Privacy Best Practices
- **Regenerate Identity**: Use "New Identity" button regularly
- **Clear Messages**: Clear chat history after sensitive conversations  
- **Verify Encryption**: Ensure the 🔐 encryption indicator is active
- **Trust No One**: Verify peer identities through out-of-band channels

### Security Model
- **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption happens locally
- **Zero-Knowledge**: No server can decrypt your messages
- **Anonymous Routing**: Messages pass through multiple relay nodes
- **Ephemeral Keys**: Encryption keys are temporary and non-persistent

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Encryption
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (simulated)
- **Key Exchange**: Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: New keys for each session
- **Authentication**: HMAC-SHA256 message authentication

### Network Protocol
- **Transport**: WebRTC DataChannels
- **Discovery**: Distributed Hash Table (DHT)
- **Relay**: Tor-like onion routing (simulated)
- **Peer ID**: SHA-256 hash of public key

### Privacy Features
- **No Metadata**: Timestamps and message sizes are padded
- **Traffic Analysis Resistance**: Random message timing
- **Plausible Deniability**: Cannot prove message authorship
- **Anonymous Identities**: Cryptographically generated pseudonyms

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Current Limitations (Demo Version)
- This is a demonstration/proof-of-concept
- Real P2P networking is simulated
- Encryption is visualized but not cryptographically implemented
- No actual Tor integration in current version

### For Production Use
- Implement real cryptographic libraries
- Add proper WebRTC or libp2p networking
- Integrate with Tor or similar anonymity networks
- Conduct professional security audits
- Add secure key storage mechanisms
